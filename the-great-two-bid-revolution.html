<h1>The Benjamin 2♣/2♦ System: A Recovering Strong-2 Player’s Guide</h1>

<p>Back in the mid-90s, my bridge life looked very different. I was learning from <strong>Ron Klinger’s Basic Bridge</strong>, which drilled into me like a sergeant-major:</p>

<blockquote>“A Strong Two shows 22+ points OR 8.5+ playing tricks.”</blockquote>

<p>So I played proudly, opening Strong 2’s as if they were medals pinned to my chest.</p>

<p>Fast forward thirty years. A cruise from Southampton to the Adriatic, ten sea days, and an Irish director with a gift for teaching rekindled the obsession. When we got home, we joined a London club — and found ourselves surrounded by a world of <strong>Weak Two openers</strong>.</p>

<h2>Weak-2 Temptation vs Strong-2 Nostalgia</h2>

<p>By the 1990s, Weak Twos weren’t just a fad — they were near-universal.</p>

<p>“Open 2<span style="color:black">♠</span> with 6-11 points and a decent six-card suit!” people urged. “It’s disruptive, it’s fun!”</p>

<p>But I resisted. <em>What about my distributional monsters? What about those Strong 2 suitors?</em> Too many sub-23 point freak hands risked dying at 1<span style="color:black">♣</span>.</p>

<p>And then, I rediscovered Klinger’s elegant compromise:</p>

<h2>The Benjamin 2♣/2♦ System</h2>

<p>This version of <strong>Benji</strong> lets you keep strong 2’s and still enjoy Weak 2’s:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Opening</th><th>Meaning</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>2<span style="color:black">♣</span></strong></td><td>Game-forcing, usually unbalanced (20+ HCP, 8.5–9.5 playing tricks; also some 23–24 balanced)</td><td>Partner can respond strong naturally or wait with 2<span style="color:red">♦</span></td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>2<span style="color:red">♦</span></strong></td><td>Strong, very powerful (23+ balanced or a 10+ PT hand)</td><td>Old-style 2<span style="color:black">♣</span> shifted to 2<span style="color:red">♦</span></td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>2<span style="color:red">♥</span> / 2<span style="color:black">♠</span></strong></td><td>Weak two-bids (6–11 HCP, decent 6-card suit)</td><td>Classic preempts</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The beauty: Strong 2’s <strong>aren’t lost</strong> — they’re repackaged.</p>

<hr>

<h2>After 2♣</h2>

<p>There are <em>two tracks</em> depending on whether responder bids strongly or offers the waiting (negative) reply.</p>

<h3>Strong or Positive Responses</h3>
<ul>
<li>Any bid other than 2<span style="color:red">♦</span> is <strong>natural and strong</strong>.</li>
<li>From here, all bidding is <strong>natural to game</strong>, and very often slam.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The 2♦ (Waiting/Negative) Response</h3>
<p>If responder bids 2<span style="color:red">♦</span>, opener describes by counting <strong>quick tricks</strong>:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Opener’s rebid</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>2<span style="color:red">♥</span> / 2<span style="color:black">♠</span></td><td>5+ suit, about 8.5 playing tricks</td></tr>
<tr><td>3<span style="color:red">♥</span> / 3<span style="color:black">♠</span></td><td>6+ suit, exactly 9 tricks</td></tr>
<tr><td>4<span style="color:red">♥</span> / 4<span style="color:black">♠</span></td><td>6+ suit, ~9.5 tricks</td></tr>
<tr><td>3<span style="color:black">♣</span> / 3<span style="color:red">♦</span></td><td>6+ suit, 8.5–9.5 tricks</td></tr>
<tr><td>4<span style="color:black">♣</span> / 4<span style="color:red">♦</span></td><td>9.5–10 tricks, unsuitable for 3NT</td></tr>
<tr><td>5<span style="color:black">♣</span> / 5<span style="color:red">♦</span></td><td>10.5 tricks, 7+ suit, unsuitable for 3NT</td></tr>
<tr><td>3NT</td><td>Long solid minor (4 top honours) with stoppers in two outside suits</td></tr>
</table>

<hr>

<h2>Common Auctions</h2>

<p><strong>Example A</strong></p>
<pre>
2♣ – 2♦; 2♥ – 2♠; 3♥ – 4♥
(A strong heart hand, fit uncovered, heading for slam territory)
</pre>

<p><strong>Example B</strong></p>
<pre>
2♦ – 2NT; 3♦ – 3♥; 4♥ – Pass
(Using Stayman after 2♦, responder uncovers 4-4 hearts)
</pre>

<p><strong>Example C</strong></p>
<pre>
2♣ – 2♦; 3NT – Pass
(A solid minor, opener takes the practical game)
</pre>

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>Benjamin doesn’t make you choose between nostalgia and modernity. You keep the elegant <strong>Strong 2’s</strong>, but also wield the gritty, disruptive <strong>Weak Twos</strong>.</p>

<p>So for anyone else still in recovery as a “Strong-2 purist,” this system lets you — quite literally — have your cake and eat it too.</p>

<p>And remember: every time you open 2<span style="color:black">♣</span> and your partner sighs with relief at not guessing, you can send up a small thank-you to Ron Klinger.</p>
