# Stayman: The Bridge Convention That Saves You From Talking to Yourself

If you’ve ever sat across from your partner in a bridge game, stared lovingly into their eyes (or maybe with mild suspicion), and thought: _“Do you have a four-card major, or am I doomed to a life of playing in notrumps?”_ — then congratulations, you already understand why **Stayman** exists.

## Why Bother With Stayman?

1. **Finding the Major Fit**  
   Bridge wisdom says: a major suit fit is gold. Hearts and spades score more handsomely than the minors or notrumps. Stayman lets you sniff out that 4-4 major fit hiding in your partner’s hand like a bloodhound on the trail of a bacon sandwich.

2. **Avoiding Notrump Misery**  
   Without Stayman, you might end up playing 1NT with four hearts opposite four hearts. That’s like turning down first-class seats for the middle row next to the toilet — technically fine, but you’ll regret it.

3. **It’s Easy to Remember**  
   Stayman is the bread-and-butter convention. No complicated sequences, no memory-breaking gadgetry. Just **2♣** asking a simple question: _“Partner, do you have a four-card major?”_

## How Stayman Works (the Simple Version)

- **Partner opens 1NT** (usually 12–14 or 15–17, depending on system).  
- **You bid 2♣**. That’s not because you love clubs (nobody really loves clubs). It’s an _artificial_ bid saying: _“Partner, do you have a four-card major?”_  
- **Partner replies:**  
  - **2♦** → “Nope, sorry, no four-card major here.”  
  - **2♥** → “Yes, I have four hearts.”  
  - **2♠** → “Yes, I have four spades.”

## A Tiny Example

**You:** ♠ KJ73 ♥ Q852 ♦ 76 ♣ 984  
**Partner:** opens 1NT.  
**You:** bid 2♣ (Stayman).  
**Partner:** replies 2♥.  
**You:** Now, depending on the points range being promised in your partnership, you can happily settle for a part-score with a good fit, or worry that you are going to miss game.

## Why You’ll Love It

- It makes you look clever without really trying.  
- It saves you from endless 1NT contracts with a lovely major fit left stranded.  
- Your partner will thank you (eventually).

## Final Thought

Stayman is like asking your partner what they want for dinner. Sure, you could just order pizza every time (1NT), but sometimes you discover they secretly wanted steak (spades) or pasta (hearts). Use Stayman — your bridge scores (and your partnership) will be all the better for it.
